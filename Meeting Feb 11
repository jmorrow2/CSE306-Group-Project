Start time 12pm
End time 3pm

Began to write out the code for parsing the arguments passed into the "csv" executable.  Worked on parsing for the arguments (flags) 
and thinking about how to organize the data from the file to make returning values easiest given which flags are present.  C prgramming
kinda sucks.
